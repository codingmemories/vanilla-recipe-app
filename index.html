            originated in <em>Italy</em> during the <em>Middle Ages</em>. The
            oldest transcribed text about lasagne appears in 1282 in the
            <em>Memoriali Bolognesi</em> ("Bolognesi Memorials"), in which
            lasagne was mentioned in a poem transcribed by a Bolognese notary;
            while the first recorded recipe was set down in the early
            14th-century

            >.It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of
            lasagne, featuring a <em>fermented dough</em> flattened into thin
            sheets (lasagne), boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, and then
            eaten with a small pointed stick. Recipes written in the century
            following the
            <span class="section-recipe__text-name">Liber de Coquina</span>
            recommended boiling the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with
            cheese and chicken fat. In a recipe adapted for the
            <em>Lenten fast, walnuts</em> were recommended.
